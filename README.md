# 🚀 Bermuda Rocket Tracker

A modern web application that tracks upcoming rocket launches from Florida (Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center) and determines their visibility from Bermuda.

🌐 **Live Application:** https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app

*Last updated: September 6, 2025 - Enhanced trajectory visualization with purple launch pad*

## Features

- **Real-time Launch Data**: Fetches upcoming launches from The Space Devs Launch Library API
- **Visibility Predictions**: Analyzes launch trajectory, time of day, and location to determine visibility from Bermuda
- **Real Weather Integration**: Uses OpenWeatherMap API for accurate Bermuda weather conditions and launch impact assessment
- **Interactive Sky Maps**: Shows rocket trajectory with constellation references and compass orientation
- **Advanced Trajectory Visualization**: Interactive map showing rocket path, visibility indicators, and accurate Florida/Bermuda geography with dark theme integration
- **Weather-Aware Notifications**: Advanced notification system considering weather conditions
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive launch statistics and visibility trends
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Clean design that works on all devices
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates launch data every 30 minutes
- **Time Zone Conversion**: Shows launch times in Bermuda time (AST/ADT)
- **Launch Details**: Displays rocket type, mission name, launch pad, and target orbit
- **Live Streams**: Direct links to official launch streams when available

## Configuration

### Weather Data Setup

To enable real weather data from OpenWeatherMap:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```bash
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
3. Restart the development server

**Note:** Without an API key, the app will use realistic simulated weather data as a fallback.

## Visibility Determination Logic

The app determines visibility based on several factors:

### Launch Location
- Only tracks launches from Florida launch pads (Cape Canaveral, Kennedy Space Center)
- Calculates distance and bearing from Bermuda coordinates (32.3078°N, 64.7505°W)

### Trajectory Analysis
- **High Visibility**: GTO/GEO launches (typically southeast trajectory) during night time
- **Medium Visibility**: LEO launches or daytime GTO launches
- **Low Visibility**: Limited trajectory visibility or poor timing
- **Not Visible**: Launches not visible from Bermuda's location

### Time of Day
- **Night launches** (after 8 PM or before 6 AM local time) have better visibility
- **Daylight launches** are harder to see due to sunlight

### Compass Direction
- Shows the bearing (compass direction) to look toward from Bermuda
- Most Florida launches head northeast to southeast (45° to 120° azimuth)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **API**: The Space Devs Launch Library 2.2.0
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm

### Installation & Running

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.
